Bettermaps is a minecraft plugin that allows playing high framerate video on groups of minecraft maps.
It also lets you display images on maps. The jar file is in the target folder.  it will create a webserver at port 4567.
Warning, the video prosessing library I am using dosent like most videos, check the console to see if it failed after uploading. 
If the video is not smooth in game try uploading a diffrent one or changing the framerate of the video.
Videos may take a while to upload, do not close the tab until it says it finished.
